# Recipe Project

The "Recipes Project" is a web application designed to help users discover and manage recipes. It is being developed using PHP for server-side logic, vanilla JavaScript for interactive features, and a touch of CSS for styling. The project aims to provide a user-friendly interface where users can browse, search, save recipes. Features may include recipe categories, search functionality, user accounts for saving favorite recipes, and a responsive design for a seamless experience across devices.


## Deployment

To run your PHP, JavaScript, and CSS code for your "Recipes Project," you'll need to set up a local development environment. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

1. **Install a Local Server Environment**: As mentioned earlier, you can use software like XAMPP, WampServer, or MAMP to set up a local server environment on your computer. These tools include Apache (for serving web pages), MySQL (for databases), and PHP (for server-side scripting).

2. **Create a Project Directory**: Create a new directory on your computer where you'll store your project files. This directory will be the root directory of your local web server.

3. **Download Your Project Files**: If you haven't already, download or copy your PHP, JavaScript, and CSS files into the project directory you just created.

``
git clone https://github.com/whoami-3F/Recipes-Project.git
``

4. **Start the Local Server**: Start your local server environment (e.g., XAMPP, WampServer). This will start the Apache server and MySQL database server on your computer.

5. **Access Your Project in a Web Browser**: Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/your-project-directory`, where `your-project-directory` is the name of the directory where your project files are stored. For example, if your project directory is named "recipes-project," you would navigate to `http://localhost/recipes-project`.

6. **Test Your Project**: Once you've accessed your project in the web browser, you should see your project's homepage or main entry point. Test your project's functionality to ensure everything is working as expected.

7. **Debugging and Development**: Use developer tools in your browser (e.g., Chrome DevTools) to debug and develop your project further. You can use these tools to inspect HTML elements, debug JavaScript code, and optimize CSS styles.

8. **Database Setup (if needed)**: If your project requires a database, you'll need to set up a local database using phpMyAdmin (included with XAMPP, WampServer) or another database management tool. Create a new database and import any necessary SQL files to set up your database schema and data.

By following these steps, you should be able to run your PHP, JavaScript, and CSS code locally for your "Recipes Project" and develop it further as needed.
